			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<hr>

			<P>Parenthood is fraught with challenges - one of which is making sure you don't forget to get out there and enjoy your life!</p>
			<p>I created Vinna as a way for parents to mark our daily triumphs - from tackling an at-home task to going on a cultural adventure, kiddo-in-tow.</p>
			<p>These badges are to be proudly displayed on your baby carrier (Ergo, for example) or on a diaper bag. Or, collect them at home, and high-five yourself every time you remember, "Yeah. I totally nailed that."</p>

			<p>The word "vinna" means "win." It also means "work." Parenthood is winning work. Celebrate your successes. You definitely deserve a merit badge.</p>
