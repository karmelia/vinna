				<p style="font-size: 17px;">Parenthood is fraught with challenges - one of which is making sure you don't forget to get out there and enjoy your life!<br> I created Vinna as a way for parents to mark our daily triumphs -<br> from tackling an at-home task to going on a cultural adventure, kiddo-in-tow.<br> These badges are to be proudly displayed on your baby carrier (Ergo, for example) or on a diaper bag.<br> Or, collect them at home, and high-five yourself every time you remember, "Yeah. I totally nailed that."<br> The word "vinna" means "win." It also means "work."<br> Parenthood is winning work. Celebrate your successes!<br> You definitely deserve a merit badge.</p>
